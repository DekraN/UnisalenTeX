\textbf{You are Otis engineers back in the l850s, when elevators were new. ln pairs, prepare a short talk to brief your sales colleagues on the advantages of elevators for lifting people and goods. Emphasise the points below using the phrases and techniques from this section. Remember that people at this time are sceptical about the technology}:

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines=true]
- Have you ever tried to get a full shop bag for five or more stories of stairs? It is not so easy, I would say.
- An elevator will sort things up! It's a comfortable way to simplify your life. No more shop bags or water bottles, for example.
- It will considerably lower your work. And I know what you will think. It's unsafe! It's Dangerous! WRONG!
- It's actually safer than climbing stairs. As you can see in this blackboard, the car is attached with a steel cable that can support several tons. 
- Surely safer than climbing stairs and maybe undergo a fall due to a slippery surface. And it's not so difficult to use as you can think.
- Not more than climbing stairs!
- The lift is controlled from the inside of the car, simply pressing a button. Just by doing this, you can climb from the basement up to the top of a skyscraper. 
- And don't forget about the economic aspects of the things. A significantly large use of lifts will help the economy of our great America. 
- How, shall you ask?
- Using lifts we can build taller buildings. And no one will complain about living at the top floor. This way, the value of the land will extremely skyrocket!

\section{UNIT 2: Materials Technology}

\subsection{2}

\subsubsection{a}

\textbf{Read the following web page and complete the missing headings using the words in the box}:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textit{Steel} Scrap can be sorted easily using magnetism. If the metal is galvanised (coated with zinc) the zinc is fully recyclable. If it is stainless steel, other metals mixed with the iron, such as chromium and nickel, can also be recovered and recycled;

\item \textit{Glass} Sorting is critical, as there are key difference between the clear and coloured material used in bottles and jars, and the high-grade material used in engineering applications, which contains traces of metals;

\item \textit{Copper} Scarcity makes recycling especially desirable, and justifies the cost of removing insulation from electric wires, which are a major source of scrap. Pure metal can also be recovered from alloys derived from it, notably brass (which also contains quantities of zinc and often lead) and bronze (which contains tin);

\item \textit{Aluminium} The cost of melting down existing metal is significantly cheaper than the energy-intensive process of electrolysis, which is required to extract new metal from ore;

\item \textit{Timber} Hardwood and softwood can be reused. However, the frequent need to remove ironmongery and saw or plane off damaged edges, can make the process costly;

\item \textit{Rubber} Tyres are the primary source of recyclable material. These can be reused whole in certain applications. They can also be ground into crumbs which have varied uses;

\item \textit{Plastic} An obstacle to recycling is the need to sort waste carefully. While some types can be melted down for reuse, many cannot, or result in low-grade material.

\end{itemize}

\item \textit{bronze}: an alloy made from copper and tin;

\item \textit{lead}: a dense, poisonous metal;

\item \textit{hardwood}: timber from deciduous trees;

\item \textit{ore}: rocks from which metals can be extracted.

\item \textit{softwood}: timber from pine trees.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{c}

\item Pure metals can usually be recovered \textit{from} alloys;
\item To produce stainless steel, iron is mixed \textit{with} other materials;
\item Stainless steel contains quantities \textit{of} chromium and nickels;

\subsubsection{c}

\textbf{Irina asks the engineers to do a simplified environmental audit. Their task is to compare steel and aluminium car bodywork from an ecological perspective. Listen to Sophia and Pete, two of the engineers, discussing the topic and make notes of their ideas}:

Sophia and Pete's ideas: Pre-use: aluminium production (extraction from ore and recycling), coating steel (galvanising), transporting and handling bulk material, cutting and welding In-use: weight (impact on fuel consumption), lifespan (frequency of manufacturing).

\subsection{5}

\subsubsection{a}

The most suitable method of joining components depends on many factors, which extend beyond the obvious issue of required strength.

\begin{itemize}

\item Will the joint need to be disconnected in the future? If a part is bolted \textit{on}, it can obviously be removed at a later date. If two components are bonded to \textit{each other} with strong adhesive, or welded \textit{together}, then subsequent removal will clearly be more difficult;

\item What external factors might affect the joint? Water or heat can weaken adhesive joints. And no matter how tightly nuts are screwed \textit{onto} bolts, vibration can cause them to work loose over time;

\item How quality-sensitive is the jointing technique? Components are rarely joined \textit{to} each other in ideal conditions. Inadequately tightened fixings, improperly prepared surfaces, or flawed welds are inevitable. How could such imperfections affect the joint negatively?

\textbf{Mei has done a revised drawing for the floor slab. Read the extract from her email about the new design and complete the message using the correct form of the words in Exercise 7b}:

Please find attached a revised drawing for the floor slab, now reconfigured for defined movement. In order to accommodate guided vehicle $1080mm$ \textit{wide} (as specified by the client) we propose a standard \textit{width} of $1280mm$ for each superflat lane. At $14.5m$, the \textit{length} of the longest lane on the network is within the maximum slab run that can be cast in a single concrete pour, thus avoiding construction joints on straight runs. On curved sections, a standard $8.5m$ turning radius is used, as per the guided vehicle manufacturer's recommendations.
In order to allow for the eventuality of future grinding, we have located the top layer of reinforcement $10mm$ deeper below the slab surface. This additional \textit{depth} has not, however, been added to the overall slab \textit{thickness}, which remains $275mm$. The reinforcing bars also remain in $12mm$ diameter. As a result, the levels of wall-mounted process installations - many of which need to be fixed at a precise \textit{height} above finished floor level - are unaffected.

\item{\textbf{Chen}}: There's a \textit{discrepancy} between these details that you might be able to \textit{clarify} straight away. On the plan of this plate, it shows eight bolts. But on section A, here, there are no bolts shown in the middle. So there would be only six, which obviously \textit{contradicts} the plan. But as you can see, this plate's going to be bolted on a T profile. So we couldn't put a row of bolts down the middle, because they'd \textit{clash} with the flange running along the middle of the T. So I'd \textit{propose} just going for two rows of bolts. The \textit{alternative} would be to redesign the T section, which would obviously be a bigger job.

Dynamic demand control systems can be fitted to electrical appliances that operate on duty cycles, i.e. appliances that start up, run for a time, shut down again, and then remain on standby for a while before repeating the same cycle. Heating and refrigeration units are common examples of power-hungry equipment that operate on this start-run-stop-wait basis.
Dynamic systems exploit the fact that duty cycle appliances do not require \textit{continuous} power. The purpose of the systems is to help smooth power demand for the benefit of electric utilities. To achieve this, they delay the start-up of the appliances they control during periods of \textit{peak demand}. However, only minor adjustments are made to timing as, generally, the appliances concerned can only be held on standby for short periods as they need to run on a \textit{continual} basis. But this still benefits electric utilities as it helps to avoid problematic, momentary \textit{blips} on the demand curve.
Dynamic controls work by detecting slight \textit{fluctuations} in the frequency of the mains AC supply. Although this varies only within a very narrow \textit{range}, small drops in frequency indicate that power station turbines are working close to full capacity. The dynamic control system can therefore hold the appliance on standby for a short time until mains frequency increases again.
